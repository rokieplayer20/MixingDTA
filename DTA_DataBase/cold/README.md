# Files naming

Unlike the Random split setting, the test file contains only one cold target and one cold drug. 

test_Drug.pkl is test dataset of cold drug setting and test_Target.pkl is test dataset of cold target setting.


The file names are formatted as `{train or valid}_{fold}_{cold}.pkl`.

For example, train_1_Drug.pkl is train dataset for cold drug setting in 1-fold.
